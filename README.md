# Widgets
Widgets for user interfaces in Python

I'll upload some widgeys and code related to UIs in Python, mainly using PySimpleGUI, Kivy and tkinter.

# Splash.py

This is a "splash screen"-like function. It uses PySimpleGUI (tkinter, Windows) and was made as part of a big project. It basically is just a program with an animated picture and a cancel option that interrupts the execution of the whole program. It supports transparency, and fast load of the animated picture. You can adjust the speed of the animation, and other options.

- You can call this function at the start of your program to emulate a splash screen.
- The gif has to be of the type that is one picture per frame (including background and static pixels).
- You can create/edit gifs using GIMP.
